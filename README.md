# WritingYourFirstDjangoApp
Tutorial: Writing your first Django app

This project represents my progress on the tutorial “Writing your first Django app” available on the django web page:
https://docs.djangoproject.com

I published this project because I encountered several issues following the different steps of the tutorial.

Taking in account that Stack Overflow is full of threads related to this tutorial, I’m not the only one facing this issue.

I kept the commits very small to improve documentation and to highlight steps progression.

Then, if you are stuck in some specific point of the tutorial, here you can find how I went forward.

I followed the latest tutorial available at the time, using an installed Django 1.8.7.

In order to preserve against changes of the online version, I added in the repository the offline html documentation of Django, embedding also the tutorial.

Environment Used:

OS: Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (xenial)

Installed Django version 1.8.7

Installed Python version 2.7.12

Tutorial followed Django 1.11
